# Rock-Paper-Scissors
TOP RPS Game
I started abobe my head with a semi working site - jumped straight imnto DOM and was working out until I hit some hick ups I just couldnt wrap my head around - SOO 

Ive started fresh. I completed a mostly working version of this that i have since deleted as i want to complete it while using git ... and just for the extra practice.

Ill try to update this read me along the way as well.. sort of a reference file for myself!
